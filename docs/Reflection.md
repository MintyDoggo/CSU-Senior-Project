# Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. What was the challenge, was it technical, nontechnical, or both, and how did you overcome it?

One challenge I encountered during my academic development was learning what I excelled at and which direction to move in the field of computer science. For example, when I started my time at CSU, I was so confused that I thought about switching majors. The longer I stuck with computer science and explored my interests, the more I learned which field to pursue.  

While this is more of a non-technical challenge, I believe overcoming it has done me more good than overcoming a very niche technical challenge. I've found a great cross-section between computer science and music, allowing me to be happy with my work and have opportunities.

# Discuss a situation where you worked with a team. How would you describe yourself as a teammate? Where can you improve your team skills? Be specific.

During my object-oriented class, I worked in a team for the final project with Chris, Alex, and Yasmeen. Working together online taught me how to communicate information specifically and clearly. As a teammate, I am usually the one doing the more technical work. Chris and I led this project on the technical end while Alex and Yasmeen did more of the documentation and other aspects. In the end, we all did a fair share of both. As for where I can improve as a teammate, I tend to get carried away with what I do, leaving people behind or out of the loop. I recognize how important it is to be considerate of others when working together and communicate properly.

# What type of career in CS do you believe you are most suited for? Why this field and not another? Be specific.

I believe a career that explores the intersection between music and computer science is where I would excel. I say this field because it is directly related to what I currently do as an entrepreneur and in my free time. Creating digital instruments is something that I am very passionate about and aspire to learn more.

# What professional organizations would you like to join? What professional development would you like to be a part of in the next five years? Be specific and don't consider places of employment.

When thinking about professional organizations, ACM is the first that comes to mind since I was already a member of the ACM club in my university. I'd like to contribute to the professional development of digital instruments and innovate the way we use sample library technology.

# What are the ways you can use the skills you have learned in CS to serve your community? Be specific.

With the skills I've learned in CS, I plan to serve the community by teaching essential CS skills to students. I also plan to contribute to the production team of various churches and provide assistance where I can.
