### Statement of Purpose (with the Problem Statement)
In the world of audio production, there exists a type of software called Kontakt. Kontakt is the industry standard sampler VST that allows you to play instruments (such as violin, cello, etc) digitally. Not only can the user play these instruments, but Kontakt has developed a language in which you can develop your own digital libraries. While most libraries focus on achieving realism and representing the instrument as well as possible, some companies push the boundaries and allow you to manipulate the sound creatively. An example of this is Noire by Galaxy Instruments. This is a normal piano library that has an audio granulator engine built in.
