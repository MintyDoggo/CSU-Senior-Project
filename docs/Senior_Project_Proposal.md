## Problem Statement:
In the multiplayer gaming world, having authentic users is vital to a game’s survival. Many multiplayer indie games take advantage of users by faking their online multiplayer. These users used to not know better but recently, many YouTubers have exposed their games for faking player counts. In the age of online multiplayer games, this is unacceptable that many games can fake their multiplayer just because the game is based on a simple idea. This is important because there is a hole in the market that needs to be filled: users want to play with real players, especially during this pandemic.
My solution is to meet the market’s demand by creating ZooKeeper 40, a game with real online multiplayer similar to Mario 35 and the old ZooKeeper game. My game will be intuitive, free, and allow users the chance to connect with each other to enjoy a true multiplayer experience. Consequently, users should have the ability to connect with authentic users online in this age of multiplayer games.

## Project Description:
This project is a modern implementation of an old videogame named ZooKeeper from 1983. The idea is to bring an old classic back to life through the power of modern development tools and net code. The game works by controlling a character (the zookeeper) to run around a box that contains animals. As you run, the box builds bricks under you that the animals can break. The goal is to keep them in as long as possible and not get hit. My implementation will take this game idea and recreate it with modern graphics and original theming. I then want to create a multiplayer game out of it where around 40 people can play the game at once. When a player catches an animal, instead of it going back into the cage it goes to another person's screen and the last one standing wins.  

## Proposed Implementation Language(s):
C++, GDScript, C#  
## Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used in the proposed implementation languages(s):
Unreal Engine, Unreal Engine dedicated server, and Godot Engine  
## Additional Software/Equipment Needed
Visual Studio Community 2022, Visual Studio Code, Github  
## Personal Motivation
I’m a musician and aspiring game developer. This project will further my knowledge in the field of game development as well as give me the creative ability to make music and sound effects. I will learn what are good practices for creating efficient games and using dedicated server net-code. One of my game ideas that I want to make is a fighting rhythm game where every interaction has to be on the beat. This takes a thorough understanding of net code, which is another reason why I want to make this project. I will also cover a broad range of concepts in the game development field through this project, making me more confident to specialize in a certain branch of game development.  
## Outline of Future Research Efforts
I will complete this project by researching and developing it during the Summer of 2022 to see what works and what does not. I will need to learn how to replicate player data to clients using a server authoritative approach. Deliverables to expect are the game itself as a standalone solo player application as well as some form of multiplayer using a dedicated server.
